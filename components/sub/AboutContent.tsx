          I am a versatile Full Stack Junior Software Developer with expertise in website, mobile, software, and game development. I have strong skills in C++, C#, TypeScript, and JavaScript, along with experience in frameworks such as React, Node.js, and Three.js. I am a fast learner, able to quickly adapt to new technologies and methodologies, and excel at collaborating with clients to deliver scalable, efficient, and user-friendly solutions that address real-world challenges.

          In addition to development, I have a passion for 3D animation, proficient in tools like Maya, 3ds Max, and Unreal Engine. I thrive in team environments and enjoy working closely with others to achieve common goals. I'm always eager to expand my skill set and embrace new opportunities for growth.

          Over the past year, I've focused extensively on C++ and game development using Unreal Engine, and Iâ€™m actively seeking opportunities to pursue my passion for game development within the gaming industry.
